TESTS:

ls: 

cd:

pwd:

!ls: Initially we had implemented !ls using a different method, and didn't use the system call directly. This resulted in us not beign able to use ls with any other parameters (such as -a,-l). Once we realied the assignment needed us to use those parameters, we changed it to a system call immediately, and put in the right mechanism to read all the flags too.

!pwd:

!cd:

Authorization (Errors in checkpoitn 1): 

In our first checkpoint, we had a single auth variable. This meant that once one user had logged in, the other users wouldn't need to login because the variable would already be set to logged in.

We realize this fact very early in testing after we started working for our final submission, and changed it immediately.
