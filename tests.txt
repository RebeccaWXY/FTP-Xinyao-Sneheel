Issues solved throughout the process:

GET,PUT

ls: Initially, due to miscommunication, we had 

cd: The code for cd on the client

pwd:

!ls: Initially we had implemented !ls using a different method, and didn't use the system call directly. This resulted in us not beign able to use ls with any other parameters (such as -a,-l). Once we realied the assignment needed us to use those parameters, we changed it to a system call immediately, and put in the right mechanism to read all the flags too.

!pwd:

!cd:

Authorization (Errors in checkpoitn 1): 

In our first checkpoint, we had a single auth variable. This meant that once one user had logged in, the other users wouldn't need to login because the variable would already be set to logged in.

We realize this fact very early in testing after we started working for our final submission, and changed it immediately.


Test Environment:

In order to test our code as robustly as possible, in the virtual machine we created the followign test environment:

Client location: /Documents/Client

Server location: /Desktop/FTP

Files were placed in different file directories across the system to check for navigation errors and file transfer errors.
